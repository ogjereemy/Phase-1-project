        <h3>Facts About Foxes</h3>
        <div id="facts">
            <p>Red foxes are highly adaptable mammals, at home from the country to the city. They prefer the edges of forests and fields and can be seen on golf courses and city parks. Red foxes are in the canid, or dog, family. They also share some behaviors with cats like stalking and pouncing on prey, running sideways, and walking on toes. Red foxes can also run nearly 30 miles per hour and leap fences.</p>

            <p>Although they come in many shades, their telltale sign is their white-tipped tail. Nearly all red foxes have this marking. Their bushy tail is used for balance, warmth, and signaling others.</p>

            <P>Their hunting skills are aided by stealthy senses of smell, hearing and night vision. Red foxes can hear the low frequency sounds of small animals digging under the ground, leaves, or snow. They use the earth's magnetic field to help zero on their prey before pouncing.</p>
